# Real world functions
# buyLunch("Nasi", "Ayam", "Teh O")
# In the above example we are passing 3 arguments

# Every programming language will come with many built in functions
# print is a one of the python built in function
# over here print is the function name
# to invoke/call a function, function name is followed  by ()
# function will take arguments between (....)
# here we are passing "Hello World !!!" as an argument
print("Hello World !!!")

# there are 3 types of literals/values in this world
# What is your name "Yuz" String literal
# What you eat today "Roti Kosong" String literal
# How many ? 2 Number literal
# How much you pay ? 2.40 Number literal
# Cheap ?? Yeah Boolean literal
# Where you went ? "Pasar Malam" String literal
# What you buy ? "apple", "orange", "mango" List of String literals

# Important point:
# String literals in computer are always enclosed with double quote ""

# What you buy yesterday
print("Television")
# How many
print(10)
# How much
print(1455.55)
# Was it Good
print(True) # eventhough True looks like string literal it is not
# string literal it is boolean literal (no need to enclose with "")
# Watch out T is capital
# Which means True is a reserved word we call them as "Keywords"
# Python has many "keywords" such as True, False

# Important point:
# Any programming language must have keywords they are building blocks for our program
# There can be a programming language without built in function but 
# there is no programming language without Keywords

print("10") # 10 becomes string
# In real world example car plate number is a string we cannot add 2 car plate numbers

# So far we have passed single argument to the print function
# Now let us see how to pass more than one argument to the print function
print("apple", "orange", "mango")
# in the above example we are passing 3 arguments
# print function takes more than one argument separated by comma
print("apple", 10, 1.20)
# the output will print all the arguments separated by space
# after print it automatically goes to the new line and prints the next value
print("apple", 10, 1.20)

# Special characters that can be used with print
# We call these characters as escape sequence
print("Hello David,")
# \ becomes escape sequence when it is attached with characters
# \t means tab key
# \n means new line
# \r means carriage return
print("\tAs I am not feeling\n\tI won't be able to attend the meeting")
print("Hello welcome to python class \rDear,")
